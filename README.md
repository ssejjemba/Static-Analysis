# Static Analysis Tool setup for javascript

In this repo, I cover static check tools for javascript.
These tools help catch simple bugs and avoid the dark side of the javascript dynamic nature.
It is important for Engineers to be comfortable with setting up and using these tools in their own projects.

## Project Setup

The project is setup from ground up to use commit messages that communicate the intention of the changes.
The best way to gain from this project is by reviewing the commit messages and looking at how you would go about setting up and using static checking tools in your own project.

This project can also be used as a boilerplate for those who are uninterested in setting up static tools for their own projects but need a boilerplate to customise through the steps.
